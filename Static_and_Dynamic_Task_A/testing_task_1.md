### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card) #Ruby should be snake-case
    if card.value = 1 #should be double equals
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2) #should be def not dif and arguments need to be comma separated
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card #should be card1
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end  #this end is superfluous

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total # the variable named total should be set to = 0
  for card in cards
    total += card.value # this for loop should be ended
    return "You have a total of" + total # Space after 'of' AND the variable total should be converted to a string using .to_s
  end
end
```
